sentence=Handcrafted 64-bit floating point routines for AVR/arduino microprocessors.
paragraph=fp64lib is a library for implementing 64-bit floating point arithmetic on the AVR MegaAVR architecure microprocessors, like the popular Arduino series. Data format is fully compatible with IEEE 754 binary64 standard. V1.0.7 is now compatible with Arduino Mega and fixed rounding bug in fp64_to_string
